h1. StretchMinder

Stretch! Stretch I tell you!

A little (kind of) native osx app that reminds me to get up and stretch every x minutes. I say kind of because I used MacRuby to build this app, so you'll have to download MacRuby to run it. Also, it requires the hotcocoa gem for the interface and Growl/GrowlNotify to actually notify you.

I think this app is cool because its simple, and even lets you set multiple intervals & messages to be notified on/with! It uses Grand Central Dispatch to asynchronously queue up the notifications.

h3. Requirements:

* "Growl":http://growl.info/
* "GrowlNotify":http://growl.info/documentation/growlnotify.php
* "MacRuby":http://www.macruby.org/
* sudo macgem install hotcocoa
